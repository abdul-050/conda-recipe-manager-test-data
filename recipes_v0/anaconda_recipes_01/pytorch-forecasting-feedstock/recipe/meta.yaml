    # This basically forces to pick scipy (and any other suitable packages in the chain, like numpy)

    # By default, mkl variants are picked. By picking the variant that uses openblas rather 
    # than mkl, intel-openmp will not be pulled in and so you will not have llvm-openmp / intel-openmp conflict.

  summary: Timeseries forecasting with PyTorch
  description: |
    PyTorch Forecasting is a timeseries forecasting package for PyTorch build on PyTorch Lightning.
    It provides timeseries datasets and dataloaders, various ways to normalize variables
    and a number of neural networks for forecasting. The package is tightly integrated with tensorboard
    for logging.

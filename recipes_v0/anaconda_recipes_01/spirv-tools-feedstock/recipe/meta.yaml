  # Note: there are a number of build dependencies that get downloaded via a utility in the source 
  # repo: `git-sync-deps`. This is run for both unix and windows via the build.sh and bld.bat,
  # respectively. Alternatively we could:
  #   - list them here as sources and put them in their correct locations.
  #   - build out packages of them and list them as build requirements.

  summary: 'The SPIR-V Tools project provides an API and commands for processing SPIR-V modules.'
  description: |
    The project includes an assembler, binary module parser, disassembler, validator, and optimizer
    for SPIR-V. Except for the optimizer, all are based on a common static library. The library
    contains all of the implementation details, and is used in the standalone tools whilst also
    enabling integration into other code bases directly. The optimizer implementation resides in
    its own library, which depends on the core library.

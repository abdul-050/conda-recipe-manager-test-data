  summary: Python package to accelerate the sparse matrix multiplication and top-n similarity selection
  description: |
    Sparse_dot_topn provides a fast way to performing a sparse matrix multiplication
    followed by top-n multiplication result selections. Comparing very large feature vectors and
    picking the best matches, in practice often results in performing sparse matrix multiplication
    followed by selecting the top-n multiplication results. In this package, we implement a
    customized Cython function for this purpose. When comparing our Cythonic approach to doing the
    same use with SciPy and NumPy functions, our approach improves the speed by about 40% and
    reduces memory consumption.

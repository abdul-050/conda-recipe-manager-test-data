  summary: A set of estimators for models and (robust) covariance matrices, and tests for panel
    data econometrics, including within/fixed effects, random effects, between, first-difference,
    nested random effects as well as instrumental-variable (IV) and Hausman-Taylor-style
    models, panel generalized method of moments (GMM) and general FGLS models, mean
    groups (MG), demeaned MG, and common correlated effects (CCEMG) and pooled (CCEP)
    estimators with common factors, variable coefficients and limited dependent variables
    models. Test functions include model specification, serial correlation, cross-sectional
    dependence, panel unit root and panel Granger (non-)causality. Typical references
    are general econometrics text books such as Baltagi (2021), Econometric Analysis
    of Panel Data (<doi:10.1007/978-3-030-53953-5>), Hsiao (2014), Analysis of Panel
    Data (<doi:10.1017/CBO9781139839327>), and Croissant and Millo (2018), Panel Data
    Econometrics with R (<doi:10.1002/9781119504641>).

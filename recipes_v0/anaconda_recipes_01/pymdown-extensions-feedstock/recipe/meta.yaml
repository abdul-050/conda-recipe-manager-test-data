  summary: Extension pack for Python Markdown.
  description: |
    PyMdown Extensions is a collection of extensions for Python Markdown. 
    They were originally written to make writing documentation more enjoyable. 
    They cover a wide range of solutions, and while not every extension 
    is needed by all people, there is usually at least one useful extension for everybody.

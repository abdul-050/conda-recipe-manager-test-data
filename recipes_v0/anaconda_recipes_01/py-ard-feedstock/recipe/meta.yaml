  summary: ARD reduction for HLA with Python
  description: |
    Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes encode cell surface proteins
    that are important for immune regulation. Exons encoding
    the Antigen Recognition Domain (ARD) are the most polymorphic region of HLA genes
    and are important for donor/recipient HLA matching.
    The history of allele typing methods has played a major role in determining
    resolution and ambiguity of reported HLA values.
    Although HLA nomenclature has not always conformed to the same standard,
    it is now defined by The WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System.
    py-ard is aware of the variation in historical resolutions and grouping
    and is able to translate from one representation to another based on alleles published quarterly by IPD/IMGT-HLA.

  summary: FastAPI framework, high performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production
  description: |
    FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
    The key features are:
    - Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.
    - Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *
    - Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *
    - Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
    - Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
    - Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
    - Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
    - Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.

  summary: Serialization library for Exceptions and Tracebacks.
  description: |
    It allows you to:
      * Pickle tracebacks and raise exceptions with pickled tracebacks in different processes.
        This allows better error handling when running code over multiple processes
        (imagine multiprocessing, billiard, futures, celery etc).
      * Create traceback objects from strings (the from_string method). No pickling is used.
      * Serialize tracebacks to/from plain dicts (the from_dict and to_dict methods). No pickling is used.
      * Raise the tracebacks created from the aforementioned sources.
      * Pickle an Exception together with its traceback and exception chain (raise ... from ...) (Python 3 only)
    Again, note that using the pickle support is completely optional.
    You are solely responsible for security problems should you decide to use the pickle support.

  summary: 'TensorFlow Probability is a library for probabilistic reasoning and statistical analysis in TensorFlow'

  description: |
    TensorFlow Probability is a library for probabilistic reasoning 
    and statistical analysis in TensorFlow. As part of the TensorFlow
    ecosystem, TensorFlow Probability provides integration of
    probabilistic methods with deep networks, gradient-based inference
    via automatic differentiation, and scalability to large datasets
    and models via hardware acceleration (e.g., GPUs) and distributed
    computation.

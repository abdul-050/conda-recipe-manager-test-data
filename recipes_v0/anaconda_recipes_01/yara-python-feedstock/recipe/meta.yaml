  summary: "Python interface for YARA"
  description: |
    YARA is a tool aimed at (but not limited to) helping malware researchers
    to identify and classify malware samples. With YARA you can create descriptions
    of malware families (or whatever you want to describe) based on textual or binary
    patterns. Each description, a.k.a rule, consists of a set of strings and a boolean
    expression which determine its logic.

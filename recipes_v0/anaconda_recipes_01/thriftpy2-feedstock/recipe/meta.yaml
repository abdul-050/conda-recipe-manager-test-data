  summary: Pure python implementation of Apache Thrift.
  description: |
    ThriftPy2 is a pure python implementation of Apache Thrift in a pythonic way.

    The official thrift python lib is not pythonic at all, it needs a complicated process of installation, and 
    the generated sdk is very ugly. Everytime the thrift file changed you have to re-generate the sdk 
    which causes more pain in development.

    ThriftPy2 helps that, it's compatible with Apache Thrift so you no longer need to install 'thrift' 
    package, it can import thrift file on the fly so you no longer need to re-generate the sdk again 
    and again and again.

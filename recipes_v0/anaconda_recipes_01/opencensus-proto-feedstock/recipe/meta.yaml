  description: |
    Census provides a framework to define and collect stats against metrics and to
    break those stats down across user-defined dimensions.

    The Census framework is natively available in many languages (e.g. C++, Go,
    and Java). The API interface types are defined using protos to ensure
    consistency and interoperability for the different implementations.

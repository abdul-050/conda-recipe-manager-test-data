  summary: Python charting for 80% of humans.
  description: |
    Leather is the Python charting library for those who need charts now and don't care if they're perfect.
    Leather isn't picky. It's rough. It gets dirty. It looks sexy just hanging on the back of a chair. 
    Leather doesn't need your accessories. Leather is how Snake Plissken would make charts.

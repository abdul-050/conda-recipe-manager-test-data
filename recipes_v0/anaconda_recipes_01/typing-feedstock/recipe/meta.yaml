  summary: Type Hints for Python - backport for Python<3.5
  description: |
    This is a backport of the standard library typing module to Python versions
    older than 3.5. Typing defines a standard notation for Python function and
    variable type annotations. The notation can be used for documenting code in
    a concise, standard format, and it has been designed to also be used by
    static and runtime type checkers, static analyzers, IDEs and other tools.

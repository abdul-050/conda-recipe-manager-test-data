  summary: Implementation of a function 'digest()' for the creation of hash digests of arbitrary
    R objects (using the 'md5', 'sha-1', 'sha-256', 'crc32', 'xxhash', 'murmurhash',
    'spookyhash', 'blake3' and 'crc32c' algorithms) permitting easy comparison of R
    language objects, as well as functions such as'hmac()' to create hash-based message
    authentication code. Please note that this package is not meant to be deployed for
    cryptographic purposes for which more comprehensive (and widely tested) libraries
    such as 'OpenSSL' should be used.

  summary: 'Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.  A large part of
    Boost is provided as C++ template code which is resolved entirely at compile-time
    without linking.  This package aims to provide the most useful subset of Boost libraries
    for template use among CRAN packages. By placing these libraries in this package,
    we offer a more efficient distribution system for CRAN as replication of this code
    in the sources of other packages is avoided. As of release 1.81.0-0, the following
    Boost libraries are included: ''accumulators'' ''algorithm'' ''align'' ''any'' ''atomic''
    ''beast'' ''bimap'' ''bind'' ''circular_buffer'' ''compute'' ''concept'' ''config''

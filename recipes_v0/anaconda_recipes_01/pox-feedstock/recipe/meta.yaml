  summary: utilities for filesystem exploration and automated builds
  description: |
    pox provides a collection of utilities for navigating and manipulating filesystems. 
    This module is designed to facilitate some of the low level operating system interactions 
    that are useful when exploring a filesystem on a remote host, where queries such as “what 
    is the root of the filesystem?”, “what is the user’s name?”, and “what login shell is 
    preferred?” become essential in allowing a remote user to function as if they were logged 
    in locally.

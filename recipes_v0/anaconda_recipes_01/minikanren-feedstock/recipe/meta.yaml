  summary: An extensible, lightweight relational/logic programming DSL written in pure Python
  description: |
    Logic programming is a general programming paradigm. This implementation however came about specifically to
    serve as an algorithmic core for Computer Algebra Systems in Python and for the automated generation and
    optimization of numeric software. Domain specific languages, code generation, and compilers have recently been a
    hot topic in the Scientific Python community. Kanren aims to be a low-level core for these projects.

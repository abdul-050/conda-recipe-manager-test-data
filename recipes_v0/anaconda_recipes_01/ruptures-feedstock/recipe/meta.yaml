  summary: Change point detection for signals, in Python
  description: |
    `ruptures` is a Python library for off-line change point detection. 
    This package provides methods for the analysis and segmentation of 
    non-stationary signals. Implemented algorithms include exact and 
    approximate detection for various parametric and non-parametric 
    models. ruptures focuses on ease of use by providing a well-documented 
    and consistent interface. In addition, thanks to its modular structure, 
    different algorithms and models can be connected and extended within 
    this package.

  summary: Functions are provided for computing the density and the distribution function of
    d-dimensional normal and "t" random variables, possibly truncated (on one side or
    two sides),  and for generating random vectors sampled from these distributions,
    except sampling from the truncated "t". Moments of arbitrary order of a multivariate
    truncated normal are computed, and converted to cumulants up to order 4. Probabilities
    are computed via non-Monte Carlo methods; different routines are used in the case
    d=1, d=2, d=3, d>3, if d denotes the dimensionality.

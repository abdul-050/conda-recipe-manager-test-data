  summary: An open source python library for automated prediction engineering.
  description: | 
    Compose is a machine learning tool for automated prediction engineering. It allows you to structure prediction problems
    and generate labels for supervised learning. An end user defines an outcome of interest by writing a labeling function, 
    then runs a search to automatically extract training examples from historical data. Its result is then provided to 
    Featuretools for automated feature engineering and subsequently to EvalML for automated machine learning

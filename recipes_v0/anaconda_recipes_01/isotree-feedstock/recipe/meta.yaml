  summary: Isolation-Based Outlier Detection, Distance, and NA imputation
  description: |
    Fast and multi-threaded implementation of Isolation Forest (a.k.a. iForest) and variations of it such as Extended
    Isolation Forest (EIF), Split-Criterion iForest (SCiForest), Fair-Cut Forest (FCF), Robust Random-Cut Forest
    (RRCF), and other customizable variants, aimed at outlier/anomaly detection plus additions for imputation of
    missing values, distance/similarity calculation between observations, and handling of categorical data.

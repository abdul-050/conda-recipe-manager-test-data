  summary: dlfcn-win32 is an implementation of dlfcn for Windows.
  description: |
    dlfcn is a set of functions that allows runtime dynamic library loading. It is standardized in the POSIX. Windows
    also provide similar routines, but not in a POSIX-compatible way. This library attempts to implement a wrapper
    around the Windows functions to make programs written for POSIX that use dlfcn work in Windows without any
    modifications.

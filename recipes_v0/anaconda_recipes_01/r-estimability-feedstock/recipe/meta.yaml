  summary: Provides tools for determining estimability of linear functions of regression coefficients,
    and 'epredict' methods that handle non-estimable cases correctly. Estimability theory
    is discussed in many linear-models textbooks including Chapter 3 of Monahan, JF
    (2008), "A Primer on Linear Models", Chapman and Hall (ISBN 978-1-4200-6201-4).

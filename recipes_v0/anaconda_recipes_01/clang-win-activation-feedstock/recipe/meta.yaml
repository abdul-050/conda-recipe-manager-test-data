       export CONDA_BUILD_WINSDK=/opt

    To use this package in a conda-build environment, add the following

       CONDA_BUILD_WINSDK:
         - "/opt"

    in $HOME/conda_build_config.yaml and use `clang_win-64` as the compiler.

    By setting this variable, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions
    of the Windows SDK and the MSVC headers. If the Windows SDK and MSVC
    headers are not inside CONDA_BUILD_WINSDK, they would be automatically
    downloaded.

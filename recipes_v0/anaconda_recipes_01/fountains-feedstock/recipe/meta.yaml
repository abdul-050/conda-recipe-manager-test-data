  summary: |
    Python library for generating and concisely specifying reproducible pseudorandom binary data for unit testing.
  description: |
    This library makes it possible to generate pseudorandom binary test data in a reproducible way, as well as to embed
    concise specifications of correct function behavior on that test data. This enables the construction of functional
    tests within unit testing suites that fit within one-line definitions but still test a functionâ€™s behavior against
    a large number of inputs.

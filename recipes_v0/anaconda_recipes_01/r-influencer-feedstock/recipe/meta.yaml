  summary: Provides functionality to compute various node centrality measures on networks. Included
    are functions to compute betweenness centrality (by utilizing Madduri and Bader's
    SNAP library), implementations of constraint and effective network size by Burt
    (2000) <doi:10.1016/S0191-3085(00)22009-1>; algorithm to identify key players by
    Borgatti (2006) <doi:10.1007/s10588-006-7084-x>; and the bridging algorithm by Valente
    and Fujimoto (2010) <doi:10.1016/j.socnet.2010.03.003>. On Unix systems, the betweenness,
    Key Players, and bridging implementations are parallelized with OpenMP, which may
    run faster on systems which have OpenMP configured.

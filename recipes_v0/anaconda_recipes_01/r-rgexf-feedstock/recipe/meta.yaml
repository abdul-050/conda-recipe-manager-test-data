  summary: Create, read and write 'GEXF' (Graph Exchange 'XML' Format) graph files (used in 'Gephi'
    and others). Using the 'XML' package, it allows the user to easily build/read graph
    files including attributes, 'GEXF' visual attributes (such as color, size, and position),
    network dynamics (for both edges and nodes) and edge weighting. Users can build/handle
    graphs element-by-element or massively through data-frames, visualize the graph
    on a web browser through 'gexf-js' (a 'javascript' library) and interact with the
    'igraph' package.

  summary: Provides some low-level utilities to use for package development. It currently provides
    managers for multiple package specific options and registries, vignette, unit test
    and bibtex related utilities. It serves as a base package for packages like 'NMF',
    'RcppOctave', 'doRNG', and as an incubator package for other general purposes utilities,
    that will eventually be packaged separately. It is still under heavy development
    and changes in the interface(s) are more than likely to happen.

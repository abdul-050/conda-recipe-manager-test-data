  description: |
    STUMPY is a powerful and scalable Python library that computes something called a matrix profile, 
    which can then be used for a variety of time series data mining tasks. It provides efficient algorithms 
    for tasks such as similarity search, motif discovery, time series segmentation, and anomaly detection.
